# Possible controlled vocabularies:

## Organization types (`institutionTypes`)
- http://www.isni.org/filedepot_download/140/451 ISNI upload forms (organization types)
- GRID: https://www.grid.ac/. Seems to be a subset of ISNI

## policyTypes
Should these come from re3data? (probably just need a note)

## institutionContactTypes
Should these come from r3data?

## element name="Format"
Move to application interface (are there libraries for these things?) [@BRANDON]
